## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Main thing I have learned working on this project was adding custom fonts to projects. Biggest obstacle was to make this project look smoothly on my old Iphone 7 Plus. Spent few hours working on @media's with different width's, playing in Google Chrome Dev Tools. Had a first practise with HSL color palete.


### Continued development

Biggest issue from this project at the moment is mobile responsivness, and fonts.

### Useful resources

- [Box shadow](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me with shadows :)
- [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me make a layout with Flex box.
